It highlights that while human cognition is Turing Complete, meaning capable of executing any calculation given enough time and memory, today's LLMs do not meet this standard. The write-up further reflects on the dependency of modern human cognition on our abilities to communicate ideas or lengthen our working memory.\"\n},\n\n{\n\"Missing_Entities\": \"Turing Machine; paper; read/write head\",\n\"Denser_Summary\": \"The paper progresses with an overview of the Turing Machine \u2013 a theoretical device consisting of a tape, a read/write head for the tape, and a finite state machine controlling these elements. It asserts that humans, in combination with paper and pencil, are equivalent to Turing Machines. The tape in a Turing Machine embodies the paper, while the read/write head represents the eyes and hand with a pencil used for calculations.\"\n},\n\n{\n\"Missing_Entities\": \"Finite State Machine; Turing's process; computation principles\",\n\"Denser_Summary\": \"The state machine, another element of Turing Machine, embodies the human mind involved in calculations. The paper provides a peek into Turing\u2019s own process of computation, showcasing him introspectively pondering about his mathematical problem-solving. His focus was breaking down his mental steps into their primitive components, thereby accessing the essence of mathematical computations.\"\n},\n\n{\n\"Missing_Entities\": \"Symbol manipulation; interaction with symbols; cognitive properties\",\n\"Denser_Summary\": \"The conversation moves along, pondering why people generally equate humans and Turing Machines. It unveils the power of symbol manipulation as the underlying principle. Interestingly, it talks about a scenario where a person visually and manually interacts with symbols, suggesting that the cognitive capacities of a person do not remain the same when they interact with these symbols during computation.\"\n},\n\n{\n\"Missing_Entities\": \"LLMs like GPT; Turing-completeness; external representations\",\n\"Denser_Summary\": \"Towards the end, the article talks about recognizing the Turing-completeness in LLMs such as GPT by providing access to external representations - equivalent to Turing's paper and pencil. Despite improvements in their accuracy and capacities, LLMs will always be questioned for their correctness. It is suggested that harnessing external representations can help better understand their computations.\"\n}\n]"
