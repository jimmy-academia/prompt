Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a popular form of digital asset that allows for unique identification and ownership. These tokens, often seen as collectible artworks, are characterized by their distinct traits and rarity. However, determining the value of NFTs is a complex process that requires achieving market equilibrium between the preferences and budgets of multiple bidders, as well as considering the breeding mechanism that allows buyers to combine multiple items for additional value. In this paper, we aim to unravel the intricacies of NFT valuation by examining the various factors that contribute to the market price of each individual NFT item. By analyzing the traits, attributes, and buyer preferences associated with NFTs, we seek to formulate a framework that can establish an equilibrium market price for these unique digital assets.
