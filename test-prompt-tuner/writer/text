Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which can be viewed as collectible artworks, enables unique identification and ownership of digital assets. While their uniqueness and rarity are signaled through a trait system, their valuation cannot be found without obtaining market equilibrium between the complex interplay between the preferences and budgets of multiple bidders and the breeding mechanism which allows buyers to obtain additional values through the combination of multiple items. In this work, we navigate the intricate landscape of NFT valuation by disentangling traits, attributes, and buyer preferences to formulate an equilibrium market price of each NFT item.
