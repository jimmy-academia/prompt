The description of economic upswings, as well as their drawbacks like unemployment in the globalized economic world, and the social changes related to the emergence of economic migrants, are recurring themes and primary concerns in picturebook narratives published in the early decades of the 21st century. Chih-Yuan Chen’s renowned picturebook, The Best Christmas Ever, published in 2003, stands as an exemplary work addressing a family’s experience during a financial crisis. The story begins by describing the dire circumstances faced by Papa Bear, the anthropomorphic father figure, who loses his business, becomes jobless for long, and eventually plunges the family into poverty. However, Christmas is approaching, and both parents understand that it is a time when every family member expects a gift. Despite their challenging situation, the parents make every effort to prepare for Christmas. The mother creatively crafts decorations from old clothes, while the father collects sticks to fashion a makeshift Christmas tree. Nevertheless, they have no gifts to give. On Christmas morning, to the family’s astonishment, each member receives a special gift—something they had lost and cherished dearly. The only exception is the Little Bear, or the youngest child, who receives an old baseball glove restored to look like new. While all family members are contented with the gifts they received, the sister notices that there are tiny footprints on the ground. Knowingly, the family claims that it was not Santa Claus but rather the Shengdan Xiaoxiaohai, or “Santa the Little Child”, who came to their aid and bestowed these gifts upon them. Despite the economic hardships, the family celebrates a very special Christmas, spending time together to cherish their recovered possessions in good memories. Familial love, as the story accentuates, is what matters the most after all.
