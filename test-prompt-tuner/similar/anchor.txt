Children’s literature is conventionally understood as a literary genre which works to instruct as well as to entertain young readers. Similar to adult literature, it comprises a number of categories, such as fiction, non-fiction, short stories, poetry, rhymes, children’s songs, children’s plays, picturebooks, manga, and graphic novels. The hybridization of literary genres and the crossover readership targeting both young and adult audiences can be marked as striking phenomena of the development of children’s literature in contemporary Taiwan in the wake of globalization. With the advance of modern technologies, ebooks, digital games, and narrative apps for children are the new media popular among young people, not to mention animations and films. Children’s literature which used to be relegated to the literary periphery has evolved and transformed into a productive cultural field and has become a vibrant area of study in the academia since the late 1990s and at the turn of the 21st century.
Historically, albeit the formation of Taiwanese children’s literature can be traced back to the Japanese colonial period and encompass the oral literature of the indigenous tribes, the subject of modern Taiwanese children’s literature did not come into a palpable shape until the mid-1960s, when ertong duwu bianji xiaozu (the Editorial Task Force for Children’s Books) was established in 1964, under the auspices of the United Nations Children’s Fund, to operate as a governmental office in charge of juvenile publications. In a span of nearly four decades (1964-2002), the Editorial Task Force published over nine hundred children’s books, designating picturebooks, fairy tales, and children’s stories as supplementary readings for lower graders at the elementary school, whereas young-adult fiction and non-fiction for advanced readers. Pan Renmu  and Lin Haiyin, the renowned female writers in early postwar Taiwan, were members of the first editorial team and Pan later became the editor-in-chief (1969-1981) of the Editorial Task Force; both in their professionalship as children’s literature author and editor advocated for a child-centered approach to the writing and publishing of children’s books.
