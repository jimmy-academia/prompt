"Revised_Draft": "Narratives dealing with economic boons and their pitfalls such as unemployment in the era of globalization, along with social shifts triggered by the emergence of economic migrants, serve as recurrent themes and central concerns in picturebook stories published during the early years of the 21st century. Chih-Yuan Chen’s esteemed picturebook, The Best Christmas Ever, published in 2003, exemplifies a work that addresses a family’s ordeal during a financial calamity. The story commences by portraying the grave circumstances encountered by Papa Bear, the anthropomorphic patriach, who experiences business failure, unemployment for a prolonged period, and eventually leads the family into poverty. However, as Christmas nears, both parents are cognizant that this occasion is one where every family member looks forward to receiving a gift. Despite the adversities, the parents pull out all the stops in preparation for Christmas. The mother ingeniously fabricates decorations from old clothes, while the father gathers branches to assemble a makeshift Christmas tree. Nevertheless, they are left without any gifts to present. On Christmas morning, the family is stunned to discover that each member has received a special gift—something they had lost and treasured. The only outlier is the Little Bear, or the youngest child, who receives an old baseball mitt, refurbished to appear new. All family members express gratification with the gifts they received, yet the sister notices that there are miniscule footprints in the room. The family smilingly suggests that it was not Santa Claus but rather the Shengdan Xiaoxiaohai, or “Santa the Little Child”, who graced their home and gifted these treasured possessions. Despite the financial constraints, the family celebrates a distinctive Christmas, bonding over their regained possessions and nostalgic memories. The story underscores that at the end of the day, familial love is the most valuable possession."
